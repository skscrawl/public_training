It isn't easy for children who have to grow up without seeing their parents. Safie's parents weren't cruel, and they certainly weren't bad people, but they were largely absent from her life. When her pregnancy came to light, the young and very newlywed Mr. and Mrs. Delais decided they weren't yet in a position to raise a child. Together, they sat down with his older brother--Safie's soon to be uncle--and worked through the arrangements she would live with. Though they would be allowed the occasional visit, they would be her parents in genes only; her uncle would raise and care for her. Naturally, as she grew and observed the other families around her, this unorthodox family dynamic planted a dissonance in Safie's developing mind. She saw her classmates, all of them, living and connecting with their mothers, their fathers, while she...wasn't. She couldn't. They were alive and well, and kind when they visited, but why wasn't she allowed to live with them? Was there something wrong with her? And the more she thought on it, the more she stewed. Why did she care so much? Was her uncle not enough for her? Even as her uncle encouraged her and her natural curiosity, those inklings of dissatisfaction never stopped stirring within her, so while her drive to learn grew vaster every day, her capacity for frustration dwindled. Safie would rage into confrontations for the slightest irritation; picking up anything from shouting matches to physical fights, for most of her teenage the only way she knew how to let out her anger was through aggression towards other people. And her uncle didn't fully grasp the severity of her actions until Safie needed to be checked into urgent care for a set of stitches. The last fist fight she found herself in ended with her landing on a chain link fence, partially skewering her stomach across it. At last putting his foot down, her uncle resolved to find her a less destructive way to ease her temper. A hands-on approach seemed like the best option--and so with some contemplation, mindfulness exercises, and a bit of light kickboxing for the especially bad flare-ups in aggression, Safie spent her remaining three years of school slowly, but surely, training her anger. Her emotional health better secured, Safie graduated with relatively high grades. She had always intended to continue her education, but despite her uncle handing her pamphlets like clockwork, no campus ever grabbed her. A year out of high school, and what felt like a thousand brochures later, Safie was, to put it lightly, intrigued by a school who thought the best way to attract students was to invite them via physician report.
The bus had barely opened its doors before Safie kicked off from her front-row seat. Stairs? Nah. She braced herself on the metal railing and vaulted down over the three low steps separating her from the exit, barely ducking in time to miss the door frame as she did so. With a salute to the bus driver, a smirk, and a spin on her sole, up went the hem of her blouse as she knotted it tight below her rib cage. Her smile and steps never faltered as she strode well ahead of her fellow students. A new school, with new rules, but she was going to take this opportunity with her own terms.
As cruel as she is beautiful, you would be a fool to underestimate Fantomera Cross. She is a woman with goals, self-assured, cunning, and with so few scruples to speak of there seems to be no task too outlandish to keep her from something when she is driven to have it. If she speaks to you with any kindness, be wary, as it certainly means she wants something from you. Fantomera has truly loved only one thing in her entire life, and that was taken from her the day her daughter impaled her through the chest. She can act and improvise quite well, still surprising herself sometimes. The good doctor habitually keeps others at arms length, yet her masquerades have kept them from being pushed too far...just in case she has use of them later. She views most people only as tools for her own advancement. Despite having a generally negative attitude towards those who rely too heavily on others, Fantomera believes in personal reciprocation. Adequately perform a service for her, and she will assuredly return the favor in full, even if she would normally not think you worth the effort. Never let it be said she is unfair; clinical and kind of creepy at times, but not unfair. Fantomera does not dispose of something, or someone, she still sees use in. Her tendency to preserve, even actively protect, a resource is about the closest thing to true friendship one can expect from her. "Waste not, want not, my dears." She was hospital director for a reason, having spent a near century studying and practicing medicine. Fantomera has an almost perfect knowledge of fundamental mammalian physiology and knows exactly how to make you hurt if you cross her. Her perceptive and kinesthetic senses are abnormally acute, allowing her to react so quickly and so precisely that it often catches others off-guard. Fantomera is an outstanding medic, capable of performing field assists as efficiently as if she were back in her operating theater. With just a scrap of cloth and a small battery, she can bandage and soothe* injuries to get her partners back into the fight. The better materials she has to work with, the better she can patch you up. Though she lacks the magical abilities her daughter was born with, even average Argions are immune to electrical damage and can turn that energy against those who try to harm them with it. Basically, if you come at them with a stun baton or lightning spell, you're in for a very nasty shock. Literally. Fantomera's prideful miscalculations handicaps her from detecting deceit, and she underestimates those she views as incapable. This leaves her vulnerable against those who hide their true nature or abilities. The less impressively you present yourself, the easier it is to sneak up on her. Plain and simple, she is a noncombatant; Argions are more durable than most, considering they're made of metal, but Fantomera lacks raw physical strength and has absolutely no combat experience. If she finds herself in a fight, the only way she'd be able to win is by getting in close and incapacitating her opponent before they can pin her down. Against two or more, she's almost guaranteed to be overwhelmed, and thus depends heavily on her partners to escape danger. Argions are extremely weak to high temperatures. Even a simple candle can be a dangerous weapon against them due to the low melting point of their bodies. A standard fire spell is often enough to knock them out, or even kill them if they don't quickly escape the heat radius.
"I am more than what you tried to make me." A sharp pain, a warm darkness, and then...light, burning her eyes. The afterlife? But...no. She knew this place. Walls of square, silver doors and a biting cold...this looked like the morgue of her hospital, and yet, she couldn't quite rule it out as the afterlife. At the edge of her vision stood, as absurd as it seemed, a demon. What else could look so twisted and wretched with a smile that split its own face open? Fantomera's hand floated over her chest, and she felt a deep, painless indent beneath the cloth covering her body. She sat up, clutching the sheet close, and forced herself to focus on the creature waiting eagerly at the foot of her table. "You, young man," she croaked. "If you have answers, speak. Otherwise...for the love of God, go find me some clothes."
Fantomera had a bad childhood experience wherein her father, grief-stricken by the death of his wife, jumped too eagerly at the chance to help his city's councils develop a balanced form of social security--creating an unlivable home for himself and his daughter in the process. Mildly traumatized and blaming, not her father, but the infantile system he had poured all his faith into, Fantomera ran away from home and found sanctuary within a grand hospital, where she grew up and spent an absurd amount of time memorizing everything she could from their staff and archives alike. Her goal was self-sufficiency, for herself and the entire population. As an adult, now the surgeon director of the hospital, Fantomera's research lead her to an indescribable phenomena--Argions who could create their own electricity--and became consumed by the idea of replicating and manufacturing this ability. She tracked down one of these Argions and bore his daughter without his knowledge (and once he found out, it didn't end well for him). Fantomera raised her child, Marianne, to fully develop her inherited supernatural skills. But the day Marianne discovered her mother's lifelong scheme was the day she ended it...until a drug-addled ex-passenger of the World Train named Cain exhumed Fantomera's corpse and resurrected her to join him on his journey.
The Charaidon system was meant to bring stability and a sense of community to the two great cities of Vivante Bassi, and it did...eventually. The early versions, like any new system, had to be tested for balance, and to do that the councils required resources--and volunteers. Fantomera Cross was a young girl when the call for public service reached their home in Spinasut. Her father was a kind man, but eager and restless after becoming a widower. In what would prove to be the first in a series of grief-ridden coping mechanisms, the elder Cross accepted the councils' initial request to test their new Charaidon system. "Open your home," they said, and he did exactly that. The next day, Fantomera, still reeling from the death of her mother, found herself sharing a room with the children of total strangers, struggling to find even a moment of privacy in a house that had once seemed large as a castle. The trial week of living on top of one another passed slowly, and at the end, though Fantomera was immensely relieved to have her space back, her father was not pleased. The home, to him, felt emptier than ever. Then, the following month, the twin councils sent out another call for volunteers, and he, once again, leaped at the opportunity in spite of his daughter's protests. This second test asked simply for donations--of money, clothes, home amenities. In his eagerness to help, and likely exacerbated by his mounting loneliness and grief, Cross emptied their house of all but a few necessities. Several of Fantomera's belongings were packed away while she slept--toys, clothes, and even a precious music box that had once belonged to her mother. Upon awakening to a room gutted of its contents and a house blanker than her father's stare that morning, something within the young girl broke. Everything was fine, would have been fine, if it weren't for that cursed council and their "Charaidon." If everyone could just take care of themselves instead of relying on the weak-willed and gullible like her father. If, if, if... Fantomera would never appreciate the ironies of that decisive night; a system devised to open the hearts of the populace caused her to close hers off, and the third test she refused to wait for would be the test chosen to expound upon, and eventually perfected. She had only the faintest of plans as she packed everything her father hadn't stolen from her and departed that night, after Cross fell asleep. Small and clever, the girl managed to stow away in a wagon heading north, curling up in a ball amidst the cargo as she endured the bumpy ride to the heart of the great city. The white-stone heart of civilization, her mother had called it--the Grand South Hospital.Nestled within the hospital was a secondary school, and it was not difficult for Fantomera to insinuate herself into the class; with a few tearful gasps and a tale roughly along the lines of, "my parents left me at the corner two days ago and I'm getting very hungry, do you know when they'll be back, Miss Nurse?", the young girl was set on her way to being adopted by the hospital staff. Fantomera's sharp mind, combined with her finesse and decisive attitude, allowed her to sail through her education on a fair wind. But as pleased as she was spending each day cocooned in an ever-expanding web of knowledge, she never forgot the anger of her childhood neglect, nor had she ever directed that anger at the one who truly deserved it. Her hate for the Charaidon system was as strong as the day she left home, and along her meteoric rise through the hospital's ranks, she uncovered the existence of a remarkable thing; a thing that sparked a fire in her mind. A fire, unknown to her, that would eventually burn her to the ground. In her years of studying family histories and tissue sample, of countless case studies and house calls, a pattern began to crystallize before her very eyes. There was something...inexplicable in the biology of a handful of people to pass through Grand South Hospital; something that defied the laws of energy, something self-improving, something self-sustaining. It was a kind of mania that gripped her soon after this epiphany, though outwardly, her staff would swear, she always remained their cool, collected Director. A full year of sleepless research, of pillaged public and private records, all to track down the tiniest common thread tying these unique Argions together. Fantomera was determined to find herself a subject, and eventually, she found him. In her sister city, at the very northern edge of a Spinaunor textile town, she discovered Malher. Malher was a young man; a weaver, tall and slender with a heart-shaped face and a smile so infectious even the exhausted doctor caught herself smiling back when she visited his home. Despite this, and sporting the most garish hair modification she'd ever laid eyes on--a bright red of all possible colors he could have picked--she refused to be distracted from her goal. Under the pretense of a routine house call, wearing her long-tested role of the gentle, caring physician, Fantomera extracted from Malher exactly what she had been looking for for so long--electricity from nothing, sparking between his fingertips and pulling his flesh into tiny needles with it. And what had he been doing with his remarkable talents, biology that truly marked him as one in a million? Absolutely nothing. It took a great deal of Fantomera's patience not to drop her act then and there in a fit of sheer anger at the man. The good doctor would continue to carefully curate Malher's trust, hiding her absence from the southern city within Spinaunor's Grand North Hospital. There was nothing odd about one director touching base with another, after all; this, in spite of the fact Grand North's director spoke to her exactly once during her entire visit. It took two and a half months for Fantomera to craft the illusory relationship Malher believed he'd developed with her, but the morning she discovered her pregnancy, she departed without a word, having gotten exactly what she set out to do. Marianne's birthday was the only moment of pure affection she would show her daughter. The words she whispered on her newborn child's temple were loving, in their own way, but ultimately as sinister as Fantomera's intent: "You were born to inherit this world." Though Fantomera was now a mother, one would struggle to call her motherly. Barely a week after Marianne was born, she was returning to her routine at Grand South Hospital, with her infant daughter never far away--either held close or cradled by nurses ordered to remain by her side. These early years would have been ordinary, if not for an unforeseen visitor one fateful day. A short time after Marianne's first birthday, Malher arrived at the hospital and called for their director by name. He'd come all the way from the northern city, hurt by her abrupt departure, and was understandably shocked to find the woman he sought carrying a sleeping child--a child with a face uncomfortably like his own. Fantomera, placid as ever, though raging inwardly at this intrusion, this unexpected threat to her work, calmly invited him to her home for dinner. There, she promised, they could have their talk. True to her word, Fantomera prepared an exquisite meal that night, during which she coolly admitted to her guest that all she had wanted out of him was his lineage--a child born with his abilities--but since he had made himself such a nuisance in tracking her down, she would be sure to find another use for him. Malher had barely stood before the drug she slipped him kicked in. He woke up, tied to a bed in her guest room, the next morning. It's hard to say what precisely Fantomera had initially planned for her prisoner, because after a few fruitless weeks of his pleading to be let go--of screaming himself hoarse in the hopes that perhaps a neighbor would hear him--his hostess found him dead. He'd bitten off his own tongue and bled to death to escape being held there any longer. Following Marianne's thirteenth birthday, at her daughter's request no less, Fantomera began training her in surgical research and practice, pleased by the ambition of her child and viewing it as an appropriate course of study while she waited for her abilities to manifest. Marianne would not realize until decades later that her first Argion autopsy was the preserved body of the father she never got to meet. Years of lessons, of Marianne's growing power and ability, and Fantomera could not have been happier with the development she was seeing. Though she had been unsure about allowing her daughter, now nineteen and eager to apply her skills, to take lessons with the other interns of her hospital, her fears were abated when she witnessed Marianne flourishing more than she ever had when it was the two of them alone. In a sense, Fantomera was proud of her daughter--the sheer awe this young protege inspired in patients and doctors alike marked the beginning of Marianne's future in her mother's plan. Three years passed in high spirits for both mother and daughter, both for different reasons. Marianne was close to achieving the title of doctor, at the end of her training, while Fantomera was preparing the final stage for her plot. Her dear daughter had grown into everything she could have hoped for--a master of the inexplicable gifts passed down by her father, and more brilliant than any of her peers. This was the culmination of her research, she knew: the pinnacle of their race, and soon it would be time for Marianne to lend her body to the advancement of their people, in more disturbing ways than one. However, the doctor would not have the opportunity to introduce Marianne to her plan herself. Early one morning, with a flash of curtains flooding her room with sunlight, a groggy Fantomera found herself pinned by that very daughter, who just hours before had uncovered her mother's research materials. Abhorrently disgusted by her discovery, Marianne whispered a final admonishment before ending her mother's life on the spot. "I am more than what you tried to make me." These words were burned into Fantomera's mind, even beyond death. It was quite a shock that she found herself waking up, not in her bed, but on a cold metal table, just a thin white cloth separating her from the frigid air of her own morgue. From the gaping, yet painless wound she felt on her abdomen, she knew her encounter with Marianne had not been a dream, and still...she lived. At the end of her table stood a strange young man--Cain, he called himself--and he had brought her back. Even more curiously, this Cain was familiar with her wayward daughter. In the year following her death, Marianne had boarded a mysterious, magical train; he'd met the young woman there, and learned of her, he quoted, "ruthless Mam who couldn't even have a child without wanting to make it part of her megalomanic plans!" Cain needed such a person to meet his own goals, and exhumed Fantomera to help him. And if this second lease on life hadn't been enough to ingratiate himself, Cain was sure to mention one tiny stipulation of her resurrection: now more than ever, Fantomera is on borrowed time. The fatality sustained from her daughter is very slowly draining her humanity--slowly, but constantly--and without a more permanent solution (say, one that could be found on an undying vehicle of magical machinery?), she will die...this time for good. Fantomera, not one to let such an opportunity to pass her by, agreed, and the two set off on their journey.
Always smiling with just a hint of mischief in her eye, Marianne is incorrigibly optimistic, cheerful, and overall a very affectionate little lady. She playfully teases and pokes fun, but never with any unfriendly intentions. Sometimes she gets a bit overzealous and doesn't abide by laws of personal space. Many accidental shocks have come out of this. She does not like dealing with negativity and she'll smother those emotions if she starts to feel them. She's uncomfortable with anger and sadness and will be especially friendly to people who exhibit these characteristics in an attempt to cheer them up or calm them down. This is mostly for their benefit, but it's also so she can bear with being in the same room as them. Because she would much rather suppress her negative feelings than deal with them in stride, she is prone to outbursts when stressed, and this will lead to her isolating herself until she feels like she's able to wear a smile again. Pointing out any way that she seems to act like her mother is great for giving her a crisis and driving her into that isolation state. Often she'll speak without realizing she's thinking out loud, a residual habit from half a lifetime without other people. She's perceptive as a rock so it's almost impossible for her to sense moods in conversation, but that's because she's still learning about people and their nuances. Be patient with her and she'll love being around you! To Marianne, almost everything is classified as important information, including views that clash with her own. Provided those differing morals aren't hurting anyone, she's likely to spend the next twenty minutes fervently asking for every minute detail about those beliefs and how they came to form them. Knowledge is power! Her mother had no regard for the lives of others, so Marianne feels duty-bound to keep people safe, even at a personal cost and even if it means she needs to harm one to protect many. It's her attempt to make up for her mother's actions. Always thinking, she is determined to keep learning new things, and though she knows mistakes are completely necessary...she can be sarcastically overly dramatic when she gets frustrated, with the most excessive displays including (but are not limited to): temper tantrums, obnoxiously stomping around, and loud frustration-venting on a pillow or at a nearby companion.
Marianne was the daughter of a large hospital's Surgeon Director and did not have a great relationship with said director (aka, her mother)--though not for lack of trying on Marianne's part. In an attempt to grow closer to and gain her approval, young Marianne solicited her mother to teach her about biology and surgery so that she could become a doctor, just like her! Most of her life was absorbed in research (which she liked) and dissections (which she loved), and as a young woman, she believed she was on the brink of attaining the professional title and maternal recognition she so coveted when a bombshell--or rather, a file--dropped. As it turns out, Marianne was the result of her mother's lifelong hunt to isolate a magical anomaly in Argions, and from it breed the perfect form of their species. Unsurprisingly, this discovery did not sit well with her, and soon after uncovering her origins, she encountered Allison, who offered an easy out of this situation on the World Train. After a...bloody parting gift to her mother and a commemorative hair color change, Marianne boarded the train and the rest is history!
Marianne wasn't born into a very loving household, which is surprising considering the almost manically cheerful woman she would grow up to be. Fantomera Cross did not suffer with being a single mother--in fact, most of Marianne's infancy was spent in the care of nurses while her mother went back to work. Fantomera, or Dr. Cross as she would be sure to remind you, was the Director of Surgery at Spinasut's largest hospital, and had the temperament to show it. Dr. Cross was spectacularly proficient at her job, but a comforting physician she was not--Fantomera's curt and often impassive disposition was only tolerated because of her brutal efficiency in the hospital. Unfortunately, this coldness extended even towards her own daughter, and Marianne would spend much of her childhood trying to meet her mother's high expectations. Fantomera's position allowed her and a young Marianne to live very well, so the only things she ever yearned for were those that her mother most restricted. She wasn't allowed to attend school--Fantomera opted instead for a private tutor, unwilling to let her daughter mingle with "the reprobates who feed continuously off the hand of society," as she put it (much to Marianne's displeasure)--and because of that, Marianne rarely had an opportunity to meet others her own age. Time that wasn't consumed by lessons was spent at the hospital with her mother, where Dr. Cross could keep a close eye on the girl. Even the staff made themselves scarce around the young Marianne; many of them were terrified of attracting her mother's anger, as they'd been instructed not to interact extensively with her. Needless to say, Marianne's childhood was lonely and quiet, and as the years passed, she reached a last-ditch effort to lighten her life with one bright idea. Some time after Marianne's thirteenth birthday, she approached Fantomera and did two things: asked for no more tutoring, and expressed an interest in learning everything her mother had to in order to become a surgeon herself. This brought about a sliver of approval from Dr. Cross, and she, somewhat too happily, agreed to her daughter's requests. Immediately after this, Fantomera transferred several of her directorial duties to an assistant and finally gave Marianne one of the things she wanted most--her undivided attention. Their lessons began, first with enough reading and writing in half a year to fill four school semesters, and soon after, they moved to dissection. Dr. Cross started her daughter on fauna and aquatic creatures. Marianne did have some initial nausea at first, but she'd asked to learn, to grow closer to her mother through this, and so she smothered her reservations and went to work on each animal presented to her. Over time, her dissections became almost cathartic, and after another two years of alternating study and practice, Fantomera allowed her to examine her first deceased Argion. This first autopsy was surprising, for more reasons than one. The dead man possessed an anomaly Marianne had never encountered: masses of muscle had pooled at his hands, leaving much of his arms as bones draped limply with skin. Hours of examination revealed no clear explanation, much to her frustration. The second surprise came about one year after this strange autopsy, when Marianne discovered a similar change happening within her own body. Her flesh seemed to writhe under her skin--not painful, but certainly uncomfortable and entirely disturbing. However, Fantomera's reaction to was markedly...unfazed when this development was brought to her attention. It may have been her imagination, but Marianne would swear her mother was expecting this to happen. This change, Dr. Cross explained to her increasingly troubled daughter, was the result of a rare inherited ability finally manifesting itself. With practice, she would be able to put it to great use, shape herself, and eventually carve a future that "commoners"--Fantomera's eyes gleamed at this--could behold with shock and awe. Following her discovery, Marianne continued the regimen laid out for her: research, practical application, exercising these newfound skills, repeat. By the time she was sixteen, she'd practiced controlling her new powers so much that she was now able to form her own fingers into nearly every tool in her mother's medical bag. Though she knew the relationship with her mother hadn't actually changed much over the course of her surgical training--Fantomera was as cool as she'd been during her childhood--this was the lightest she'd felt in her whole life all thanks to the intense enjoyment she got out of her lessons. When she turned nineteen, Marianne was hired by her mother's hospital and, perhaps most exciting to her, was finally, finally, part of a group. She was one of a select few to be accepted--lab coats included--to intern with a resident surgeon. It wouldn't occur to her until much later that her mother may have pulled some strings to allow Marianne this opportunity. In Fantomera's eyes, it was a perfect way to display the careful culmination of these past six years. And display they did: Marianne blossomed among her fellow interns, despite a lamentable lack of social skills, and it didn't take long for her to become recognized, not as the director's daughter, but as an immensely talented young woman well on her way to becoming a full-fledged doctor. But then, the files fell. Marianne had been working at the hospital for close to three years when she came across a large, tightly-packed folder sequestered at the very back of her mother's office shelf. She'd been looking for a patient's file, and probably should have continued searching for it, but this one grabbed her attention--not only was it massive, but it had her name on it. Curiosity got the better of her, and she cracked open the folder to take a peek. Rather than a history of medical files she'd been expecting to find, Marianne was reading extensive, handwritten reports on "possible mutations", "lineage", and most disturbingly, "eventual extraction". From the massive collection, Marianne discovered this: sometime before her birth, Fantomera had become obsessed with Argions possessing the impossible ability to generate their own electricity and use it to shape their bodies to their will. She had traced hundreds of rumors before finding one of these peculiar people--and the report detailing her encounter was accompanied by a color sketch of a man Marianne recognized all too well: her first Argion autopsy, the one that had perplexed her for years. Suddenly, the lifetime of unending scientific coldness projected by her mother crashed into place: Fantomera was never raising a daughter--she was breeding a test subject, something she could create and control from the most vulnerable point in her life. And there stood that 22-year-old experiment, stunned, clutching a history she was never supposed to know, and feeling the happy lightness of her successes condense to a sour, heavy weight in her stomach. Marianne couldn't bring herself to confront Fantomera about the file. Numb and dazed, she slipped out of the hospital with the folder pressed tightly to her chest. It was the dead of night, quiet and chilled, and she wandered Spinasut for what felt like hours before a light tap on her head made her aware she was not alone on the darkened streets. Clinging to the roof of a low building was a curiously captivating woman, with dark tendrils suspending her over the side. The stranger introduced herself as Allison, and as she'd spotted the exceptionally miserable-looking Marianne exiting the hospital earlier, she had a proposition to offer. If she was unhappy with her current life and though she'd be able to handle new sights and adventures, Marianne could meet her tomorrow directly south of the city, where Spinasut ended and the treeline began. There were only a few thoughts that were perfectly clear in Marianne's mind: she now knew of her mother's twisted experiment, she now had a way to escape this fate...and she outright refused to stay another day with a woman who'd birthed a child with the soul purpose of using it as a lab rat. She told Allison she would absolutely take her up on that offer, and the two parted ways. Marianne spent the rest of the evening cramming as many clothes as she could into a single large pack, and hesitantly, stowed the pilfered file there as well. She wasn't enthralled with her discovery, but to pass up on an opportunity to learn from her mother's lifelong work would have rendered the sacrifices put into it meaningless. But stealing the file wasn't enough. Her mother had spent years tracking her first victim, and spent more still trying to mold her into a perfect specimen. That kind of drive could never be stomped out just by the loss of records, and with a clutch in her chest, Marianne knew what she had to do. When morning broke, she crept into her mother's room and threw open the curtains. Bright white light flooded into every corner and startled Fantomera awake. The back of Marianne's head prickled with heated hate as she watched the bleary-eyed woman trying to register the sudden intrusion. She whispered the last words Dr. Cross would hear before a silver spike impaled the woman several times through her heart. "I am more than what you tried to make me." Misty-headed and breathless after changing out of her blood-stained dress, Marianne gathered her overstuffed pack, her lab coat, and her medical bag, and exited her house for the last time. A thought occurred to her in her dazed, shell-shocked state, and before going to meet Allison outside the city, she stopped to enjoy one celebratory treatment her mother never would have agreed to (not that she could object now). Marianne changed her hair to the richest red the dyer could provide; a reminder of Fantomera's mistake. Upon leaving the edge of the city, Allison revealed herself from behind one of the massive trees, giving Marianne's new color a cursory look and a small smile. She led her deep into the forest, and soon they found their goal--a massive and beautiful, gleaming machine Marianne had never seen before. Allison called it the "World Train", and Marianne gleefully followed her onto it. The weight in her stomach had broken and dissolved. Marianne had spent her whole life futilely trying to live for and love someone who could have never returned those sentiments, but now, she refused to spend another second without smiling for herself. Now, she finally felt lighter than air.
"Good. Now pin back the first layer." Slightly unsteady hands, wearing too-large gloves just bloodied at the fingertips, carefully peeled away folds of cool, brittle skin to fasten them down and keep her incision open. Her mother nodded slightly. She hovered close, towering above the young girl, but never touching the body they were both so focused on; she had saved all the work just for her. Marianne's bright eyes flicked briefly to the white cloth placed over the man's head. She'd glimpsed his face, and recognized it. Not from passing on the street or within the hospital, but from her own reflection. Spying a heart-shaped face and thin, upturned nose so much like her own had sent a shiver down her spine, though she'd managed to hide her discomfort from her mother. The man's hair was peeking over the edge of the sheet, and her gaze slid over to it. Its color captivated her despite the filth clinging to it--vividly red, and marvelously different from the silver she was so used to seeing everywhere else. Her mother noticed the delay in continuing their procedure and cleared her throat. "Extract the object now, Marinette," she prodded quietly. "...Okay, Mam."
Seels are a fanged, humanoid race known for two particular qualities, the first of which is their abnormal lifespan. Through the imbibing of blood, they are able to extend their youth by considerable amounts. They are not immortal, as drinking blood merely halts aging, mental, and physical growth. Essentially, it puts Seels in a, albeit temporary, biological stasis. They do not need blood to survive and can go their whole lives without tasting a single drop. They can and will consume blood from any source, but stasis duration depends heavily what that source is. A cup of healthy humanoid blood can provide up to a decade of prolonged youth, while the same amount from non-human, warmblooded creatures gives less; about 3-5 years. Reptiles, fish, and the like give the least; a Seel is lucky to get even an extra year out of a goblet of coldblood. A well-provided Seel will usually allow themselves to age once more after they've passed 600 years, but there are urban legends of a stubborn few who try to make it past 1,000. However, none of this applies when a Seelzünd drinks their own blood, or of a blood-related family member. It should be mentioned that nothing ever needs to be killed for their blood. Nonlethal bloodletting is a very common and highly incentivized practice. The other defining quality of Seelzünds is their influential abilities. These come in a range of emotional suggestions--they can calm or demoralize, arouse or delight, embolden or, most importantly for Safie, enrage. It's evident from birth which persuasion a Seel will have, if they have one at all: heterochromia, where the color of the left eye tells all. Proper study and training can enhance their abilities, and those with the most potent powers are entrusted with positions they are naturally suited. In a few very rare (and very carefully trained) instances, Seelzünds have been able to expand their persuasions to invoke more than one kind of response from their targets. Virrechten is a middle-sized planet best characterized by the ease at which it can be divided into ecosystems--thick evergreen forests have grown tall since ancient times and sing with the calls of dark-plumed avian hunters. Warm seas studded by small volcanic islands are patrolled by fierce aquatic beasts. Sprawling grasslands with wide, clear lakes hide quiet stalkers from their prey. The only dangers in the snow-capped mountain ranges are extreme altitude, cold, and threat of exposure, but those familiar with its paths and hazards are rewarded with access to the mountains' abundance of ores, gems, and crystalline springs. Gems are a common commodity as they are found forming in every ecosystem on the planet at surface levels or slightly below. Gems excavated from deeper levels, however, are reputed to have special properties, but because subterranean digs are so difficult to undertake, there are very few enhanced gems being traded around the planet. Though there is somewhere in the hundred-thousands of settlements, both large and small, spread far around the planet, the hillside city of Hochalle is indisputably the largest and most powerful. On Virrechten, women largely run the show. They're believed to bestow good luck on their friends and families, which is why the lady of the house controls the finances and maintains its public image. Men take the last name of their brides and are integrated into her family until the couple strikes out on their own. Husbands are also expected to spend as much time child-rearing as their wives, especially if the child is male or shows signs of a similar persuasion. If a man fathers a child outside his marriage, that child is claimed by his wife's family. Full marriages, as recognized by the general population, require two criteria: the participants have at least one child together, and there is at least one female and one male presence to raise them. So, for example, if two men in a relationship, living with a female relative or friend, decide one day to take in a child, the men are now considered to be a married couple. It's the same situation if the sexes are reversed, with female partners and a male companion. Young Seels are not allowed to consume blood until they've proven their maturity by way of service to their family or community. Seels don't revere birthdays, but the party surrounding a first taste of blood can spill out of homes and sometimes pull in whole neighborhoods to join in celebration. Power dynamics in Seelzünd society are hardly balanced. People born without emotional affinities are typically relegated to lives of physical labor, servant positions, or in rare cases, outright slavery. Non-persuasion Seels who show particular mental fortitude are granted opportunities by more powerful groups for higher education and often become scholars or craftsmen, interned indefinitely to those who funded their future. For non-persuasions, access to humanoid blood is very limited, and in most cases they will only taste Seel blood when their masters want them to continue their employment for future generations. Servants can deny this offer, of course, but most do not if they've been happy with the family they serve. In a show of gratitude, everyone in the family contributes a bit of blood to the cup if the servant accepts. It's common to see blood drives where all Seels, regardless of persuasion or lack thereof, are rewarded for their donations. These are often the main draw of town festivals, during which class lines are blurred – publicly and willingly giving your blood to others is seen as a noble action, worthy of respect, and acts as a way to strengthen communal bonds. The middling class is a broad collection of folks: educators, lower merchants, brokers, the occasional non-persuasion Seels who did well for themselves, public servants, and a handful of confrontation-affinity mercenaries who stay just above lower class from their effectiveness as guards and enforcers. The middle class the largest and most diverse of the three. Hochalle houses the upper class, the very best craftsmen, hunters, warriors, luxury sellers, and diplomats, and is the birthplace of a technique for smelting metal with very little material lost. Nearly every high-quality trinket or tool can be traced to someone trained in this well-guarded method of "moring," as it was called. The advent of moring let Hochalle experience a near unending time of wealth and prosperity, and as such drew in droves from across the globe. Every class rubs elbows in Hochalle, but the descendants of the "miracle moring" technique are held in especially high esteem. The current matriarch of this family is Madrigale Moore, a Seelzünd as admired for her kindly, lilting speech as she is feared for her husband's order of Rager Knights.
Safie has always had her own ideas of right and wrong that even the longest relationship couldn't compromise. While she generally trusts her superiors not to abuse their position, she will not blindly follow orders and always contests statements she takes extreme issue with. She is as loyal to her companions as they are to her. Her strongest friendships are with those who match her in respect and moral alignment. It's not hard for her to get fired up about something. This can be either good or bad – on one hand, it means when she's engaged, she is engaged, 100%, all the way; that task is getting done one way or another. But on the other hand, that passion also means she will rarely stand down. She takes great pleasure in helping people reach their goals for self-improvement, and though she might take a rather...abrasive approach to emotional support, she has genuine affection for anyone with the courage to better themselves and the determination keep at it. Her edges soften and she becomes noticeably more playful the more she sees you fail, try again, and show your true colors under duress. Safie is a glutton for a few things: glory, victories, spoils, food, praise, and especially for punishment. While she's actually one of the more subdued members of her class she is still of an aggressive nature, rife with a number of unsavory habits including smack-talk, inciting brawls, and avoiding diplomacy like the plague. She will always try to be the dominating figure in a situation, often putting her at odds with others. If she feels slighted, she will hold onto that rage with an iron fist until she can pay it back, with interest, in whatever creative way she can concoct.
Safie Beschaad is the daughter to heiress Madrigale and Pel, captain of the Rager Knight order. She was born with the same persuasion as her father and so was was trained from a very young age by her father's second-in-command, Millos, whom Safie adored and idolized for her entire life. He taught her to harness her rage and focus it towards inciting powerful attacks and destabilizing her opponents. After Safie was granted full knighthood, Millos gave her Kalli-Mantel, her prized sword and sheath, and the two eventually went on to pursue an intimate relationship. After a near century of peaceful living (as much as can be expected when your job is all about fighting), Safie uncovered a plot Millos had been undertaking that threatened her mother's life, but unable to bring violent means against the woman he loved, Millos instead bound Safie with a suppressing amulet that keeps her from using the very abilities he'd helped her develop. Fearing for the life of her family, Madrigale made plans to go into hiding with her husband, and sent Safie to board the World Train so she could find a way to remove the amulet from her body.
Madrigale Moore's pregnancy and ensuant marriage was the talk of Hochalle for weeks. Pel Beschaad, previously the head of security hired by Madrigale's mother, was now Pel Beschaad Moore: guardian, then father, and now, husband. Their daughter, Safie, inherited her father's persuasion, and as such was raised to believe she would follow his footsteps and be the one watching over her mother. "We do not crown monarchs," her father used to say, "but your mother is pretty damn close." Madrigale refused to rest on her laurels enjoying her family's good fortunes, and insisted on making herself the target of rivals who envied her influence. She requires extra protection, he said, and so when Safie had grown enough, Pel, with permission from his wife, introduced the young girl to his order of highly trained Rager Knights – including his second-in-command, Millos Beschaad. Though they were not birth brothers, Millos lacked a family until Pel recruited him to the Ragers, and the two had been inseparable ever since; Millos even took his last name as a sign of loyalty. It was this bond that led Pel to entrust the majority of Safie's training to him. Safie was ready and eager to begin her lessons, and Millos did not hold back. Though he was instructing a child, he equipped her with weapons sized for adults and insisted if she could not wield them, she would never become a knight. Naturally, the young girl could barely lift the lightest sword at first. She fell to her teacher over and over again, and his mocking grew more intense with every failure. Then, a funny thing happened. A year after her training began, Safie had once again been beaten back by Millos and, once again, his booming insults echoing in her chest. But this time, when she wobbled back to her feet, she heard only blood rushing through her ears. She charged her teacher, lofting high the mace that hardly felt as heavy as twenty pounds should. When Millos braced himself behind his shield, Safie leapt, vaulted herself off his knee and brought the mace down square into his face. A new Rager had been awakened. Over the next two decades, Safie would continue her training, further impressing her parents, and especially Millos, with her vicious progress. He would profess loudly and often when they dined with the rest of the order that she could knock the whole of them out bare-handed; Safie more than once made him back this declaration with action, challenging him after nearly every dinner. But ever since the mace attack that shattered his nose and left it crooked, she barely managed to land another hit on him. Safie was twenty-five now, and hadn't imbibed any blood to keep herself young despite her parents having offered it multiple times every week. She refused, insisting, "Until I knock Millos on his ass, I'm not done growing." It took seven years. Seven years of continued living with the Rager Knights, of daytime patrols, of training sessions gashing deep scars into her body, every one a reminder of where she failed and how she improved. Seven years of evening discussions with her parents and their associates, and seven years of being consistently thrashed by the increasingly cocksure Millos, until one early-morning session, Safie finally managed to pull off the impossible: she taunted him, used his own technique to enrage him, kept his attention focused on her sword, and as he charged her down, tripped him up with a carefully-placed sheath stabbed in his path. At long last, she prevailed over her mentor. Madrigale and Pel were overwhelmingly proud to finally present their daughter with her first goblet of pure Seelzünd blood, and she drained every last drop of it. It radiated like a warm bath inside her veins, filling her with so much energy that she instantly declared Millos should want a rematch to save face. He refused, laughing, of course, and instead presented her with her very own weapon – the two-pronged blade Kalli and its shielded sheath, Mantel. No one could get her to put down the sword for the rest of the party. Safie had at last graduated to full knighthood in her father's order. In the years that followed, she would accompany Millos on every assignment that was passed to him by Pel. They patrolled perimeters, they investigated anonymous tips and disputes around Hochalle, and one fateful night, they raided a metal smuggler's hideout. In all the scuffle, she and Millos had been locked in two-on-three combat and he failed to notice someone cutting the rope to a crate suspended above them. In the split second it took Safie to realize this, she knocked him out of the way, but didn't get herself out in time. She awoke in her room the next morning, bandaged so tightly she couldn't move one way or the other. Millos sat at her bedside, his head lolling to one side as he slept before waking abruptly, and he breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Safie's opened eyes. After he sent one of the servants to quickly inform her parents, he leaned over her and pressed his lips to her forehead. "Crushed ribs," he said, "fractured clavicle, but you're safe. Do not scare me like that ever again, Safie." "No promises," she murmured. Not long after her recovery, Millos would linger close to her, and this did not go unnoticed by Safie. She enjoyed the additional attention. Eventually, the two became even closer, and soon it grew into an intimate relationship. Madrigale caught onto them after a few months, but it took Pel a bit longer, and then a handful of years to fully come to terms with it. This was Safie's norm for decades, of a loving family, exciting work, and a bright, open future. But it was not meant to last, and there came a year where everything started to crash around her. Safie had overheard arguments between Millos and her father, always through closed doors and always heated. The most she could make out was it had something to do with Madrigale's community work, but whenever she pressed either of them on the issue, they turned her away. For weeks, Pel's knights brought in reports of Madrigale's emissaries being slaughtered as they left the city, and though Safie insisted on wanting to lead the investigation, Millos refused. "You need to stay here and protect your mother. I can handle it." Months passed, and they brought no breaks in the mystery. Frustrated with the lack of developments, Safie pushed her father so adamantly to send her as a bodyguard with one of Madrigale's messengers that after all the pressure from both her and her mother, Pel finally relented. Safie armored up and left with an envoy the next morning. She and her quarry had made it outside Hochalle and to the base of the mountains before they were stopped in the night by a duo of black-cloaked men. Safie cut them down before they could land so much as a glancing blow on her, but received the shock of her life when she pulled their hoods back. These men were members of the Rager Knights – her brothers in arms, disciples to her father, and they'd attacked her without even a shred of recognition or remorse. Tearing through their belongings revealed only a hasty note, unsigned, but indisputably in Millos's hand: "Kill the messenger. Burn his cargo." When Safie asked the emissary to show her this "cargo," he produced a single, heavy envelope, wax sealed with her mother's crest. The pamphlet within contained instructions for the metallurgy method that had made her family so wealthy, the one that had been a well-kept secret for centuries. Safie's push back to Hochalle was furious. She'd sent the emissary on without her – if Millos had known she would be the bodyguard, he'd have sent more men. He'd no doubt be expecting another success, so she insisted he'd be safe. The incriminating note in hand, she stormed her way to the Moore estate, through the halls, and into Millos's chambers, slamming it on his desk and demanding an explanation of him. The expression on her mentor's face was not one of anger, it wasn't even one of disappointment; it was one of sadness. Millos rubbed his face and slid the note back across the desk to her, murmuring how he'd wished she'd listened when he begged her to stay out of this. Safie was shaking with rage, on the verge of tears, as he continued. "Your mother has kind intentions, I have no doubt. But if she distributes that technique to every craftsmen on the planet, it'll be disastrous. Hochalle will collapse as everyone attempts to recreate the success of her ancestors. Cheapened blades everywhere, readily available to whoever wants to buy one. Can you imagine the violence to come of it? The chaos? No...I won't allow it. Not for Pel to clean up, and not for you to endure, Safie. If Madrigale insists on sending her little messengers out, she will need to be silenced." Safie slammed her hands on his desk, but his pained eyes never left hers. "I will let no one lay a hand on my mother, Millos. Not even you." "No...I know you won't. I'm sorry, love." Two sets of hands grappled her from behind, forcing her to her knees as Millos rose, slid on a pair of dark, thick gloves and produced from his desk a glinting silver chain with a single ruby laid into it. He held it over a row of candles behind him, saying, "The woman I bought this from swore the gem could dampen even the most powerful spirit. Tried it out on myself, and she was absolutely right." The silver glowed orange now. "I was going to do this to Madrigale, but...well, let's just say you aren't leaving me much choice anymore." He turned, motioned to the guards, and they lowered a vehemently struggling Safie flat on her back. Millos knelt beside her, unbuttoned her vest to expose her chest, and pressed his lips to her forehead with another murmured apology, before laying the scorching metal chain into her collarbone and pinning the clasps to her shoulders. Safie screamed herself hoarse as the necklace seared her skin. Her eyes burned into Millos's one final time before the pain caused her to black out. When she next awoke, she was laid on her bed with Kalli-Mantel placed beside her. Despite every movement resulting in screaming agony, Safie dragged herself out of bed and staggered over to the door, only to find it hopelessly blocked. Enraged, she kicked the door with her heel several times before giving up, exhausted. She was in pain, but it was more than that – whatever Millos had done to her had cut her off from her power at its deepest core; she felt weakened on more levels than just physical. She returned to her bed, wondering how she might escape her room, when the door creaked open. Her mother, with the help of two knights, had unstopped the door. Madrigale approached her daughter, tended to her wound, and explained that Pel had suspected his old friend of deceit. She and he would be leaving Hochalle that evening, and so would Safie – just not with them. Madrigale had bought her a ticket on the World Train. In this way, she would be out of Millos's reach, and may find a way to free herself from his bind. Safie resisted violently to her mother's plan. She wanted to confront him immediately, make him pay for all he'd done, but Madrigale's resolve was unwavering. "I'm sending you off to come back even stronger. Then...then, you may return and take whatever vengeance you like. Your father and I will be waiting for you." At last, she conceded to her mother's wish. Her belongings packed, ticket in hand, and Kalli-Mantel securely at her side, Safie boarded the train, ready and more determined than ever to see this journey through.
It was a deep pain she felt in her heart, beating behind a bruised, burnt chest. Safie's fingers traced the gem from its center face, to its silver inlay, to the studs screwed into her shoulders. It was beautiful shackle, flickering reds and violets in the candlelight, but it was a shackle nonetheless. She'd been locked up, twice in one day, by the man she'd seen her future in, but whatever future she'd planned for would have to wait until she was out of bedroom-turned-prison. She sat up on her bed, staring across the room at a door that had been jammed, dead-bolted, and possibly epoxied shut, but she was still debating over that one. Kalli-Mantel had been placed on a pillow beside her, but even her beloved blade was useless against nine inches of solid oak door. Her mind buzzed with thoughts of perhaps leveraging the hinges, or commandeering every last piece of fabric in her room to make a rope out her window, when she snapped back to attention and painfully slid her legs over the side of her bed as something scraped by her door. The deadbolt slid open, and through the threshold stepped her mother, holding a bowl of water and a cloth, flanked by two sheepish-looking knights. "Thank you, gentlemen," Madrigale's gentle voice fell on Safie's ears like a warm wind, and their eyes never broke contact even as she addressed the men behind her. "Please remain outside while I speak with my daughter." The knights beat their chests once and closed the door. Safie heard them shuffling into position outside, and she took a steadying breath as Madrigale sat beside her, soaking the washcloth before gently dabbing cool water on her Safie's burned skin. "...you know," the woman said quietly as she gazed into the glinting ruby, "when I caught Millos thumbing this, he told me it was a bonding necklace. I thought he meant for betrothal." "It's binding of some kind, all right," Safie hissed through gritted teeth. Her mother's touch, though as soft as it could be, stung everywhere around the chain. "But I guess we can't trust anything he says now. How did you know what was going on? Did he try to hurt you?" Madrigale's smile was coy as she set her bowl and cloth on the floor. "Besides seeing a statue dragged across my daughter's door--like that isn't enough to tip me off, darling girl--your father suspected Millos might be losing sight of himself. He told me to be especially on my guard – oh, speaking of," she tilted her head back slightly and shouted over her shoulder, "everything okay out there, boys?" Her attention returned to her daughter when they replied an affirmative. "Securing loyalties helps that, too, in case you were worried about those two. I'm leaving tonight with them, before any more casualties arise." Safie let out a breath and shook her head. "This is insanity. You're being driven out of your own home by a traitor?" Her eyes blazed as she rose from the bed and grabbed Kalli-Mantel from its pillow. "I'm not having it. Have those men take me to Millos right now and I'll pay him back for his transgressions and especially this damn thing," she winced as her hand tugged on the gem. "You aren't doing anything of the sort, Safie," Madrigale's voice was stern, and it gave Safie pause as she stared down her mother. "I've already made arrangements for you, and they aren't in Hochalle, or anywhere near here." She stood and smoothed her dress before reaching up and placing her hands on her daughter's shoulders; Safie towered over her mother, but the small woman even now gave off a commanding air. "I've paid for your travel on the World Train, just enough to get you off Virrechten and away from Millos." "I am not running!" Safie snarled, trying to shake away her mother's hands. "Dammit, I am a warrior, Madrigale, and I'm not so helpless that a goddamn piece of jewelry will stop me from fighting him and setting this right!" Madrigale's grip tightened and Safie couldn't stop a small cry of pain from escaping her lips. "You will listen to me. You are skilled, but Millos knows everything about you, maybe even more than your father and I. You won't be able to defeat him with this...thing he's placed on you." She exhaled through her nose and slowly released Safie's shoulders, folding her hands in front of her. "I am not asking you to run away, dear. I am telling you to find a way to free yourself. Someone on the World Train or beyond must know something. Their reach is infinite. So I'm sending you off to come back even stronger. Then," Madrigale smiled, "then, you may return and take whatever vengeance you like. Your father and I will be waiting for you." Angry tears had welled up in Safie's eyes as she listened, looking down at her mother. She turned on her heel quickly and smashed her boot heel so hard into her bedside table its leg splintered and broke. She gripped Kalli-Mantel close to her heart, and after a tense moment of contemplation, relented. Madrigale produced a glossy blue ticket from her sleeve and pressed it into her daughter's hand. "When you're done packing, I'll take you to the Train. I love you, Safie." "I love you too, Mom."
Korimm did not have any trouble making the transition from her home to the circus--her home was a circus before she even knew Ender existed. Korimm's parents were the ringmasters of a traveling show, "The Asta-luego Rings." The company was performing in New Orleans when Ender's unfortunate accident unleashed the spell, and the two ringleaders were completely unaware of the curse that had hit them until they tried to have a second child. Babies usually stop looking like tadpoles in the womb at around eight weeks, but with every ultrasound taken, the more confused Korimm's mother became--their child still looked like a lizard. Odd, definitely, but it at least braced them for the moment their daughter was born--with a tail, four fingers and toes, and tiny, smooth scales spattering her body. After a few days of befuddlement, the two, admittedly eccentric, parents decided to raise and give her as much love as any other child would need. In fact, all throughout Korimm's life, they treated her like her oddities like they were nothing strange at all, even something to be celebrated. The Asta-luego Rings and its employees were like one large, accepting family, and so the little lizard grew up immensely proud of her abnormalities. She started working shows with her parents and her brother quite young, allowing her plenty of time to devise her own acts and perfect her bendy, routines. When one of Ender's tracers caught up with the company, the two ringleaders were hesitant about letting their daughter go. But to Korimm, this seemed interesting. A brand new adventure, she called it, and after reassuring and re-reassuring her parents, packed her bags and left for the new circus.
If you ask Marianne about her past, she'll probably just laugh and shrug. Because simply, the girl doesn't remember a whole lot about her history. The earliest memory she has is of makeshift shelters, tents, lean-tos, and a large group of people with such varying faces and so many different traits. Whether she had any parents or siblings, she wasn't sure, but in the marauding band she tagged along with, neither blood relation nor race seemed to matter to, well, anyone. Everyone shared food, everyone kept each other safe, and no one dared to raise a hand to another. They all seemed incredibly focused on reaching their goal--a place they called the Land of Stillness. Marianne had never been particularly close to anyone there, but she enjoyed helping around camp. As she grew, she began to show signs of magical ability, and some of the travelers took notice and taught her how to control and channel it. A few people, whom Marianne had assumed to be human, surprised her by revealing they had horns and tails, just like her! These were the ones who taught her the spell she'd use almost constantly--how to disguise herself as a human. Finally, after such a long time of wandering, the group reached a misty door guarded by a terrific beast, and after a few tense moments, the creature stepped aside and allowed the weary travelers access to the door. What lay beyond it was an unbelievable, bustling haven, The Sanctuary. And without another word to each other, the group of wanderers that had spent so many years together dispersed, going their own ways through the crowd, leaving Marianne to choose her path as well. Weaving in and around the throngs of people, she eventually found a small clinic, and, peeking through the doors, she saw a doctor and his nurse tending to a child's bleeding leg. Watching the man suture the gash so quickly, so neatly, Marianne became transfixed. He'd stopped the bleeding, without any magic! She had never been a very good healer, but what this man did was nothing short of incredible. Upon approaching the good doctor, he resolved to allow her to live with the other nurses in the clinic and learn from them; in exchange, she would work at whatever needed to be done, whether it was cleaning up blood, running errands, or trying to get a particularly fussy kid to take his medicine. She stayed in that place she could finally call home, even when the doctor grew old and retired and a new one took his place. Marianne was extraordinarily happy there, especially at, after so much time studying, the prospect of becoming a full-on doctor. But one night, as she was returning to the clinic after taking care of a few minor house calls, a sudden, sharp yank coming from right behind her throat knocked her out. When Marianne came to, she gradually realized that, somehow, she was now bound in chains and locks. Aside from being terribly gaudy, they neutralized almost all of her magic. Even worse yet, she had absolutely no idea who'd done this to her! Confused, feeling sick, and becoming increasingly frustrated, she finally heard a man's voice say: "You obey me now." Marianne does not know precisely who the man is, or what his ultimate goal is, but without exception, she must do whatever he tells her to.
Tough as nails, stubborn as a golem, sharp-tongued, and a stickler for a good time, Briar was an oddball in her own time. In life, she preferred drinking with the men at the inn instead of sitting at home doing chores--though she did them eventually when her husband nagged her enough. Already technically "old"--people in the 1600s didn’t exactly live very long--she was nonetheless popular with children because of her tendency to take part in their pranks, and because she looked after them when they got into real trouble. After death, all of these traits followed her into ghostliness, and she takes great pleasure in causing poltergeistic mischief nowadays. A social creature, Briar takes a solid form often to talk to people normally; she starts going a bit stir-crazy without some form of interaction. As far as working goes, Briar doesn’t mind it--but there are times when she’ll shirk her duties (after making sure she won’t get caught) and have a bit of fun instead.
"So, do you believe in fate?" In 1692, Massachusetts was thrown into panic over fear of the supernatural. After a series of accusations thrown about from a group of "cursed" girls, it was believed that witches moved among average people, ruining crops and poisoning waters. For a whole year, citizens were imprisoned and put on trial with charges of witchcraft, and the lucky ones were executed swiftly. Briar, a young woman living in Andover at the time, was one of the many unlucky victims. Thrown at the mercy of the court by a bitter farmer’s wife, the cruel woman claimed Briar cursed her, causing her baby to be stillborn. In truth, the farm-wife was jealous of Briar for marrying a successful blacksmith. Briar’s already well-known odd behavior certainly didn’t help her trial, and she was found guilty and sentenced to burn. Not even her husband’s bribes could free her. The day following her trial, Briar was publicly burned, choking on smoke and ash for an hour before she finally died. But instead of seeing a light at the end of a tunnel, like most dying people, Briar was suddenly standing in the crowd of her execution. After a few days of asking herself "Just what the hell is going on?", she realized she was, indeed, dead, but a wandering soul, doomed to roam until she could find her own way to the afterlife. And after years of failed attempts to communicate with her husband, Briar finally gave up on Andover and left the state. As a ghost, she realized, she was free. She could do what she wanted, roam where she would, and nothing could stop her. In the centuries following her death, Briar crossed the Mississippi River, tasted the salt of the Pacific Ocean from a pioneer ship, observed and mimicked the first traditional fire dancers of Hawaii, practiced balancing acts on an elephant in India, watched the tricky knife-and-fire eaters of the Middle East, haunted the homes of the British Isles for kicks, and even watched the impressive science of Chinese pyrotechnics. Only recently did she begin to feel homesick, and upon returning to the United States, she quietly returned to Andover. She had seen the world change before her very eyes, watching the living from the shadowy in-between world of spirits, and seeing her modernized hometown did not move her as much as one might think. On a whim, she ventured to a small section of woods--still remarkably untouched from her own era--and found there, in a high tree hollow, a thin band of gold nestled in a squirrel’s nest and engraved simply with "B&B". Shedding a few tears for the first time since her death, Briar realized it was her wedding ring, and her husband had been right to hide it in the woods, away from greedy eyes. Not even time had touched it, after all those years.
Just what had happened to her...when did she turn into such a weak little shit who couldn't handle herself? Safie tangled her fingers through her choppy red hair, shrinking into that comforting, self-protecting pose known only as the fetal position. Because right now curling up on herself was the only thing she could do to feel better. A tired red eye stared through her fingers at the room tilted on its side, or at least, that's how it looked since she was lying on her bed. Slowly, her warped, mismatched eyes closed as she took in a deep breath.  Six months. That was how long she'd been here, in this circus...the Cirque du Mirage. Home to a creepy, homicidal, dark-arts-dabbling sociopath who, for the sake of his own curiosity and, she suspected, amusement, gathered individuals from all around. Individuals who possessed powers and abilities...abnormalities beyond most human comprehension. A lengthy explanation for what could be summed up in one word: freaks. The creepy, homicidal ringmaster, a man known only as "Ender," gathered freaks at his circus and sorted them into one of four positions. Patient, talented jacks-of-all-trades who could easily perform and teach others to do so became Instructors. Travelers who knew how to dig up information and find people as easy as if they were playing hide-and-seek were Tracers, responsible for finding more freaks. Similar to them were Hunters, those quick, subtle, deadly people who got rid of anyone who posed a serious threat to the circus. And the most mysterious, most terrifying group yet--worse even than those who take the lives of others--were the strong-hearted, placid manipulators called Extractors. Those who take the souls of the Hunter's target and present them to Ender for whatever sick, unholy purpose the man needed. She thought it was a madhouse as soon as he briefed her on its inner workings. The moment the ringmaster hired her, Safie thought she wouldn't make a home here, wouldn't even try climbing any ladders. She would keep to herself and not be friendly with anyone, be a good Instructor who never stepped out of line. She would never cross her superiors or give them a reason to be cross with her. A model employee. Oh, she thought with a scowl, unfurling her body to stretch full out on the bed, pressing her bare feet against the cool wood of her headboard. How nothing ever goes according to plan. The woman drew her arms over her head, falling over the edge of the mattress. Not only did her life here not go according to plan, it completely veered in the opposite direction and sped off like a bullet train. When had it done that? Pulling her hands to cover her face, Safie listened to her own breathing for a quiet moment, digging deep into her thoughts to pull up those memories. Easter, she realized. It'd all gone downhill just days before that candy-coated holiday. Whatever holiday spirit had possessed her that day, whatever mood had struck her, she had decided to leave the circus for a brief time to pick up enough plastic eggs and chocolates to cover the circus in before the crowds arrived on Easter morning. And then Vali joined her shopping spree and somehow became the Easter Bunny for her unofficial event. Whether he was doing his job in keeping the circus free of troublemakers, or whether just wanted to harass her, to this day, Safie had no idea. After the dullard bouncer nearly killed her in the gym, one would think she'd be less inclined to interact with him. But they couldn't be farther off. Stupidly, against everything her dearest teacher ever told her...Safie had started to make a friend. Whether she knew it or not. And then she met Kylie...the Head Hunter. One of Ender's most trusted employees, in charge of all other assassins lurking in the circus. A right spitfire she was, spouting equal amounts of energy, sarcasm, and sass. On top of that, she was tough. Kylie had every deadly aspect of a lioness, from her claws to her sharp teeth to her terrifying speed. It was completely ironic, though, that Safie found Kylie dead inside on a dirt road. Just the day before, Kylie had joined her shopping trip, and she seemed fine. What, then, could've emotionally destroyed a woman with such spark? Heartbreak, as it turned out, was the answer. Kylie felt abandoned by Vali, who was trying to distance himself from those he cared about, to protect them he said. Safie knew that feeling all too well...the emptiness that came with abandonment. Especially with Vali...the one boy the Hunter had strong feelings for. She sympathized with Kylie, shared her experience, and finally realized what it was like to have a real friend. From that point, Safie made Kylie a silent promise: if getting Vali back to her would cheer her up, then she would do everything she could to make the bouncer see sense. And where was this bouncer? Still stuck in the Easter Bunny costume. After all, how could he get out with just one arm? Just a day before he had to even wear the outfit, Vali had gotten beat up. A dislocated arm and bruises all over his body was the result of that. Why Safie felt her blood boil at that...she still had no idea. She still didn't comprehend that she actually cared about him and what happens to him. So while Kylie and her state was still an issue, putting a stop to whoever was hurting Vali took root in her priorities. But all this was just the tip of the iceberg. Since pulling him out of that costume, Safie got closer and closer to the bouncer, slowly but surely starting to forget about her promise to Kylie. About the girl's feelings. Even worse, Safie, never before one to think of her own emotions...found she had feelings for him as well. To see the bouncer safe and happy...to be able to protect him and care for him was what she wanted. And what could stop her from doing that? As it turned out, a lot did. For one, Vali's assailant was none other than his own brother, Fayel. When Safie discovered this, she snapped. A punch across Fayel's jaw showed that much. And after that, there was the matter of Millo, that white-haired bastard who left her without even a goodbye. With Fayel no longer able to harm Vali--or anyone for that matter, on account of some punishment of Ender's--Safie felt things were calm enough to request a few days away from the circus to track Millo down. Accompanied by Kylie, the duo set out. But before she left, Safie did something that still shocks her even now: she kissed Vali. When she and Kylie returned to the circus, one note and one knife richer, Safie was in a state of calm, for once. She'd even managed to make a new friend, a quiet yet kind human lighting rod named Leslie, better known to her as Sparky. A sane friend, a gal pal, and a crush...where could this possibly go wrong? Apparently, it was doomed to go wrong when Safie had to confront her feelings for Vali. The bouncer frustrates her to no end, acting like a selfish child...yet also being protective and caring. She discovered his feelings for her as well...only too late. Vali had his lot thrown in with Kylie, the one who cared for him from the start. Heartbroken, yet also adamant, Safie couldn't let him go. That same stubbornness would get her into even deeper trouble. As soon as Kylie found out, she flipped. The hunter felt betrayed. How could one of her best friends do such a thing? To Safie, it was like she was accusing her of purposely trying to hurt her, which couldn't be farther from the truth. The whole excuse? Safie wasn't watching herself and got too close. Several apologies and one bruised instructor's jaw later, the two girls had a wedge shoved between them that appeared immovable. So where did this leave her now? Rejected by her crush, torn away from her gal pal, and not having seen her sane friend in a long while...she felt she had nothing. Nothing but a job and a promise from her teacher. Where could she go? What could she do? To Safie, there seemed no better option. She had to get away from everything...she had to leave the circus. Kylie and Vali would be better off without her there to confuse Vali even more. But apparently someone loves making her suffer, because the day she tried to leave Vali showed up to stop her. Drunk yet apparently still coherent enough to understand what she told him, the bouncer put her in a tough spot. If she wanted to leave, she'd have to kill him. Could she do that? Of course not. Whether she admitted it or not, she loved Vali. She loved Kylie, too, and couldn't think to harm either of them any more than she'd done already. Before things could get even more out of hand, a blessing in disguise of the ringmaster appeared and offered Safie something that, in that situation, could only be described as pure irony: Ender wanted her to become the new Head Instructor. Had she not just sunk Vali into a depression, Safie might've laughed at him. Her, the Head Instructor, just when she'd been trying to leave? Just too much. But with such a job came more work...more opportunities to keep her mind away from every bit of trouble she'd sunk herself into. Recalling Kylie's heartbreaking cries when she had told her she was leaving, and Vali's vehement attempts to keep her in the circus, Safie agreed and took the job. Looking back on it now, she mused with a scowl, she felt ashamed to have considered such a course. Even now, though, she was convinced Vali and Kylie would be better off without her. But whatever way there was to convince them of that, she had no idea. After her promotion, things calmed. Yet even a still lake can turn rampant if a big enough rock is dropped into it. Kylie, still injured from Leslie's intervention when she'd cornered Safie and punched her jaw, was still one of Safie's most cherished people. Yet tension between them was high, and even the mildest conversation was awkward and forced. She was ashamed to admit that she found herself glancing over her shoulder every now and again, expecting another assault from the Hunter. Things were hardly better with Vali, still harboring and acting on feelings for Safie (and vice versa) even with Kylie on his arm. As said before, things had calmed, but they weren't better. And then there was the "normal" period, a reprieve from abnormalities for everyone afflicted with them. For some, like Leslie, the brief window was like a drowning man's break to the surface. For people like Kylie, it was a terrible, torturous time. And for those like Safie, they couldn't care less either way. But one fact remained for all of those--they were free. Free from whatever their abnormalities hand barred them from doing before. Leslie, now as important to Safie as Vali or Kylie, entrusted the redhead with a secret of his: he couldn't swim. So the two weeks of blissful normalcy, for those two weirdos and whoever felt compelled to join them, were spent splashing in a pool and trying to prevent drowning. And now her memories had caught up to the present, and her present problem. Leslie had kissed her when she showed up at his room to offer her condolences on the return of his spark, as well as to return a very important photo of his. Embarrassed, shocked, and worst of all, conflicted, she'd run from the room like a coward. Since then, she'd been curled up on her bed, in a worthless, confused heap, debating what she could possibly do now. Once again, the thought of leaving crossed her mind. Oddly enough, the idea appealed to her now more than ever. Leave now, before screwing up your friendship with Sparky. Leave now, so Vali can finally forget about her and have a normal relationship with Kylie. Let Ender's Hunters find her, if they could, and put an end to her. She wouldn't be missed. At first there would be some mourning, but she's said this many times before: the world won't stop turning because one person dies. She was no one of immediate consequence, especially in the small circus world. Every person she met here, every one she'd formed a relationship with...they would move on and live on, and eventually realize how better their lives were without her. At this point, Safie had completely receded into her mind. Blind to everything with her eyes shut, she hadn't noticed a shadow cast over her prone form. Deaf from her own thoughts trying to psyche her up to leave, she hadn't heard an amused chuckle ring out above her. Feeling someone lean against the end of her bed and put their face dangerously close to hers, Safie peeled her eyelids away. She was only mildly surprised to find herself staring right into a pair of hollow, pale lavender eyes. "Haha...Hello, Little Red." "...Millo." "...Millo." He was here. Right in her room, leaning over her with a huge smirk as if he'd just seen her yesterday. Safie's face remained blank for all of three seconds before her eyes glazed over in tears. No. No way he was really there. Her mind was playing tricks on her. She'd obviously gone insane with stress and now she was-- "Y'know, this circus is really drab, and its workers are utterly inhospitable. Rude, too. Terrible place, really." "..." Nope. That was him all right. Safie groaned and shoved herself into a sitting position, giving Millo enough room to scoot onto the bed and pull her into his lap. Almost instantly, his arms were around her. He knew Safie inside and out. She never cried...not once had he ever seen her cry before. His Safie was tougher than that; his Little Red knew how to keep her cool. This woman burying her face against his shoulder...she wasn't his Safie. She wasn't the same one he'd left eight years ago. She'd grown up, certainly...but she'd changed emotionally as well. For example, had he tried holding her like this eight years ago, she'd have slapped him and called him a dirty old man. Leaning her face away from his arm, Millo wiped the girl's cheeks clean of any tears. Before he could move, Safie held onto his hand firmly, pressing it to her cheek. "You're here...you're actually here," she murmured, closing her eyes. "That's...great. You can take me with you now. You can let me leave..." With her teacher here, she could leave without question. He'd hide her from Ender's Hunters. If Safie learned anything from this man, it was how to hide. But actually hiding with him? Those people would be lucky to even glimpse them. "We can--" Millo held up his free hand and gave his head a small shake. "Little Red, stop right there. I'm not here to take you with me. It's still not good for you to be close to me." He paused and pouted, setting his hand to his hip. "I honestly ended up in your room by accident. I should be in New Orleans, but those damn knives dropped me here." He failed to mention that this was actually the third time his knives brought him to the circus. It was like they wanted him to reconnect with her. Not that he was completely displeased. He did miss Safie...his little knife-wielding apprentice. The poor girl had been on her own for so long, of course she'd have changed. Especially in a place like this. Millo couldn't quite put his finger on it, but there was something...strange here. He could sense something dark on Safie when he first met her, but now that same sensation was everywhere. Like there were dozens of Safies in the circus...or at least, people like her. But when he came here before, everyone seemed perfectly normal. So curious. "Anyway, I didn't come here by choice, but it looks like I couldn't have dropped by at a better time. What's wrong with you, my Little Red?" The man smirked and pulled his hand away from her face just enough to squish her cheeks together. Fishy-faced Safie did not look amused...on the contrary, she only looked sadder. Letting out a defeated sigh, he clucked his tongue and pulled her back into a hug. "What could have possibly reduced my girl to such a sorry state?" Safie closed her eyes again and leaned more into his embrace. Whether he was brought here by accident or not, she didn't care. It didn't matter. He was here now. And while she had a million more questions for him, it was clear Millo wasn't sticking around for long. When he says he isn't staying, he means it. So she'd just have to make the most of his presence at the moment. Taking a few calming breaths, she told her dear master everything that'd happened to her since her arrival six months ago, recalling every scrap of detail she could. About making friends and promptly losing them, two of them to her own stupidity. About Kylie, Vali, and Leslie. About trying to leave once before. It felt better to say it all out loud, yet at times her voice caught. Millo only listened with quiet interest, patting her head every now and then when she strained in her story. "People, basically...I was an idiot. I got too close. I should've just remembered what you told me, Millo, I'm sorry. I should've kept away from them. I tried...I tried to make friends...I tried to trust them. I wanted them to trust me, but it...I don't know what to do anymore." Safie curled her knees to her chest and buried her face in her arms. "I wish I could just forget them all...I wish I didn't remember them." A harsh wish, but one she almost meant. Had she not cherished those three so much, she'd have almost demanded Millo made it so. The man himself rested his chin on top of Safie's head, mulling over that truly lengthy tale. His poor Little Red, he thought with a small scowl. He'd left her before she'd even fully grasped how to behave, how to react...how to deal with different people. His socially-numb student would have to get herself out of this mess, but not before he offered some insight, and suggestions. If she'd listen to anyone, it was him. Based on her story, it didn't sound like she was listening to anyone else. "My dear, it looks like you've bitten off a bit more than you can chew. Between Vali and Kylie--by the way, cute girl, but she's a real bitch--and this 'Sparky', I don't know why you didn't quit the moment Kylie punched you," he chuckled and shook his head, gently prying her chin out of her arms and up to meet his gaze. "My advice to you is this, Little Red: don't shelter yourself up in here and let these negative thoughts fester. Also, don't try to run from your problems. I taught you better than that, didn't I? Mama didn't raise no fool!" Hah, he probably deserved that nasty glare she sent him. "But seriously, just ignoring everything won't fix it, it'll only make it worse. And I know you don't want that. You're not like me, Safie, you can't hurt people and just ignore them afterwards. You want to make it better, so where leaving isn't an option, the smart man's option is simply...solving it." "If I knew how to solve it, I wouldn't be here, curled up on--" "Let me finish," he frowned and gave her nose a small flick, clearing his throat. "You solve it with compromise. Let's look at your situation, shall we?" Millo leaned back a bit and held up one finger. "Kylie. Your dearest friend, the first one you made here, yes? But she doesn't trust you anymore, not after you moved in on her boy. The same boy, another one of your friends, yet also the one who's whisked my Safie's heart away, right? Oh, don't give me that scowl, you just told me so yourself. He liked you, my dear, and he still does...but Kylie got him first, and that's the end of that. For now anyway." A small smile touched the man's lips as he lowered his hand to his lap. "Presently, that's how it is. But with what's to come, well...no one can see that. Regarding your rivalry with Kylie and your little crush on Vali...let it be what it is for now. The future is full of possibilities. You want your friends to move on...you must move on first. If you're as dear a friend to Kylie as she is to you, she'll forgive and forget. ...unless she's the type to hold a grudge, in which case, I'd move on from her, too." Millo's smile curled into a wide smirk as he rested his elbow on his knee. "Now, regarding Sparky...he's obviously a caring boy. How cute is that?" "Ugh..." Safie shook her head and crossed her arms, pulling herself out of Millo's lap and back onto her bed. Everything he'd just told her about Kylie and Vali...moving on, letting him go, even for a time...hearing it from his mouth made it all the more factual and all the more bitter. If Millo said it, it must be the right thing...no matter how painful it would be, she'd have to do it. Forgetting him...her heart felt like it was being strangled in her chest. Her bangs fell over her entire face as she slumped over a bit. She barely registered what Millo was saying until the word 'cute' left his mouth. "Sparky's a sweetheart," she grumbled, burying her hand in her hair. "He's so nice sometimes he makes my teeth ache, honestly. But he's good...he's a good man. I don't want to hurt him, no more than I've hurt Kylie or Vali. I don't know if..." Safie sighed and shook her head, closing her eyes. "He's been through a lot. I want him to be happy. I'm not...I'm not a good person for him, especially for him to be happy." The last part was muttered, barely audible. Millo only laughed. "You give yourself too little credit! Little Red, you're perfectly capable of making someone happy. For a time, you and Kylie were the best of friends, supporting each other through all the hard times. Well, except this one, clearly, ahaha." He reached out and tilted her head back up to look at him, smiling never falling. "You wanted to help Kylie, you wanted her to be happy, too. And you did make her happy. This Leslie--geez, no wonder you call him 'Sparky', that's a terrible name for a boy--cares about you. He's your friend as well. However you feel about him, I certainly can't say...but if he's truly your friend, he can take whatever response you throw at him." Millo's face was practically cracking with his smirk. "Electrocute yourself jumping him or dunk him in a pool and tell him to piss off, it's up to you. Both would be interesting to watch." "..." Safie sighed and leaned against her headboard, giving the white-haired man a hard stare. "...thanks, Millo...I mean it. I'll think...and then I'll act. I hope your knives drop you here more often," a small yet genuine smile touched her lips. "I missed you too much." She let out a weak laugh and closed her eyes, crossing her arms. "Oh...don't go sentimental on me, Little Red. You know I'm not good with it," he pouted and hopped off the bed, leaning over her with a scowl. Of course, he couldn't keep that up for long. His own smile appeared on his face and he leaned down to give his girl a light kiss on the forehead. "You know I missed you, too. Take care, Little Red...I know you'll be fine." When she opened her eyes again, he was gone.
