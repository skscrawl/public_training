As cruel as she is beautiful, you would be a fool to underestimate Fantomera Cross. She is a woman with goals, self-assured, cunning, and with so few scruples to speak of there seems to be no task too outlandish to keep her from something when she is driven to have it. If she speaks to you with any kindness, be wary, as it certainly means she wants something from you. Fantomera has truly loved only one thing in her entire life, and that was taken from her the day her daughter impaled her through the chest. She can act and improvise quite well, still surprising herself sometimes. The good doctor habitually keeps others at arms length, yet her masquerades have kept them from being pushed too far...just in case she has use of them later. She views most people only as tools for her own advancement. Despite having a generally negative attitude towards those who rely too heavily on others, Fantomera believes in personal reciprocation. Adequately perform a service for her, and she will assuredly return the favor in full, even if she would normally not think you worth the effort. Never let it be said she is unfair; clinical and kind of creepy at times, but not unfair. Fantomera does not dispose of something, or someone, she still sees use in. Her tendency to preserve, even actively protect, a resource is about the closest thing to true friendship one can expect from her. "Waste not, want not, my dears." She was hospital director for a reason, having spent a near century studying and practicing medicine. Fantomera has an almost perfect knowledge of fundamental mammalian physiology and knows exactly how to make you hurt if you cross her. Her perceptive and kinesthetic senses are abnormally acute, allowing her to react so quickly and so precisely that it often catches others off-guard. Fantomera is an outstanding medic, capable of performing field assists as efficiently as if she were back in her operating theater. With just a scrap of cloth and a small battery, she can bandage and soothe* injuries to get her partners back into the fight. The better materials she has to work with, the better she can patch you up. Though she lacks the magical abilities her daughter was born with, even average Argions are immune to electrical damage and can turn that energy against those who try to harm them with it. Basically, if you come at them with a stun baton or lightning spell, you're in for a very nasty shock. Literally. Fantomera's prideful miscalculations handicaps her from detecting deceit, and she underestimates those she views as incapable. This leaves her vulnerable against those who hide their true nature or abilities. The less impressively you present yourself, the easier it is to sneak up on her. Plain and simple, she is a noncombatant; Argions are more durable than most, considering they're made of metal, but Fantomera lacks raw physical strength and has absolutely no combat experience. If she finds herself in a fight, the only way she'd be able to win is by getting in close and incapacitating her opponent before they can pin her down. Against two or more, she's almost guaranteed to be overwhelmed, and thus depends heavily on her partners to escape danger. Argions are extremely weak to high temperatures. Even a simple candle can be a dangerous weapon against them due to the low melting point of their bodies. A standard fire spell is often enough to knock them out, or even kill them if they don't quickly escape the heat radius.
"I am more than what you tried to make me." A sharp pain, a warm darkness, and then...light, burning her eyes. The afterlife? But...no. She knew this place. Walls of square, silver doors and a biting cold...this looked like the morgue of her hospital, and yet, she couldn't quite rule it out as the afterlife. At the edge of her vision stood, as absurd as it seemed, a demon. What else could look so twisted and wretched with a smile that split its own face open? Fantomera's hand floated over her chest, and she felt a deep, painless indent beneath the cloth covering her body. She sat up, clutching the sheet close, and forced herself to focus on the creature waiting eagerly at the foot of her table. "You, young man," she croaked. "If you have answers, speak. Otherwise...for the love of God, go find me some clothes."
Fantomera had a bad childhood experience wherein her father, grief-stricken by the death of his wife, jumped too eagerly at the chance to help his city's councils develop a balanced form of social security--creating an unlivable home for himself and his daughter in the process. Mildly traumatized and blaming, not her father, but the infantile system he had poured all his faith into, Fantomera ran away from home and found sanctuary within a grand hospital, where she grew up and spent an absurd amount of time memorizing everything she could from their staff and archives alike. Her goal was self-sufficiency, for herself and the entire population. As an adult, now the surgeon director of the hospital, Fantomera's research lead her to an indescribable phenomena--Argions who could create their own electricity--and became consumed by the idea of replicating and manufacturing this ability. She tracked down one of these Argions and bore his daughter without his knowledge (and once he found out, it didn't end well for him). Fantomera raised her child, Marianne, to fully develop her inherited supernatural skills. But the day Marianne discovered her mother's lifelong scheme was the day she ended it...until a drug-addled ex-passenger of the World Train named Cain exhumed Fantomera's corpse and resurrected her to join him on his journey.
The Charaidon system was meant to bring stability and a sense of community to the two great cities of Vivante Bassi, and it did...eventually. The early versions, like any new system, had to be tested for balance, and to do that the councils required resources--and volunteers. Fantomera Cross was a young girl when the call for public service reached their home in Spinasut. Her father was a kind man, but eager and restless after becoming a widower. In what would prove to be the first in a series of grief-ridden coping mechanisms, the elder Cross accepted the councils' initial request to test their new Charaidon system. "Open your home," they said, and he did exactly that. The next day, Fantomera, still reeling from the death of her mother, found herself sharing a room with the children of total strangers, struggling to find even a moment of privacy in a house that had once seemed large as a castle. The trial week of living on top of one another passed slowly, and at the end, though Fantomera was immensely relieved to have her space back, her father was not pleased. The home, to him, felt emptier than ever. Then, the following month, the twin councils sent out another call for volunteers, and he, once again, leaped at the opportunity in spite of his daughter's protests. This second test asked simply for donations--of money, clothes, home amenities. In his eagerness to help, and likely exacerbated by his mounting loneliness and grief, Cross emptied their house of all but a few necessities. Several of Fantomera's belongings were packed away while she slept--toys, clothes, and even a precious music box that had once belonged to her mother. Upon awakening to a room gutted of its contents and a house blanker than her father's stare that morning, something within the young girl broke. Everything was fine, would have been fine, if it weren't for that cursed council and their "Charaidon." If everyone could just take care of themselves instead of relying on the weak-willed and gullible like her father. If, if, if... Fantomera would never appreciate the ironies of that decisive night; a system devised to open the hearts of the populace caused her to close hers off, and the third test she refused to wait for would be the test chosen to expound upon, and eventually perfected. She had only the faintest of plans as she packed everything her father hadn't stolen from her and departed that night, after Cross fell asleep. Small and clever, the girl managed to stow away in a wagon heading north, curling up in a ball amidst the cargo as she endured the bumpy ride to the heart of the great city. The white-stone heart of civilization, her mother had called it--the Grand South Hospital.Nestled within the hospital was a secondary school, and it was not difficult for Fantomera to insinuate herself into the class; with a few tearful gasps and a tale roughly along the lines of, "my parents left me at the corner two days ago and I'm getting very hungry, do you know when they'll be back, Miss Nurse?", the young girl was set on her way to being adopted by the hospital staff. Fantomera's sharp mind, combined with her finesse and decisive attitude, allowed her to sail through her education on a fair wind. But as pleased as she was spending each day cocooned in an ever-expanding web of knowledge, she never forgot the anger of her childhood neglect, nor had she ever directed that anger at the one who truly deserved it. Her hate for the Charaidon system was as strong as the day she left home, and along her meteoric rise through the hospital's ranks, she uncovered the existence of a remarkable thing; a thing that sparked a fire in her mind. A fire, unknown to her, that would eventually burn her to the ground. In her years of studying family histories and tissue sample, of countless case studies and house calls, a pattern began to crystallize before her very eyes. There was something...inexplicable in the biology of a handful of people to pass through Grand South Hospital; something that defied the laws of energy, something self-improving, something self-sustaining. It was a kind of mania that gripped her soon after this epiphany, though outwardly, her staff would swear, she always remained their cool, collected Director. A full year of sleepless research, of pillaged public and private records, all to track down the tiniest common thread tying these unique Argions together. Fantomera was determined to find herself a subject, and eventually, she found him. In her sister city, at the very northern edge of a Spinaunor textile town, she discovered Malher. Malher was a young man; a weaver, tall and slender with a heart-shaped face and a smile so infectious even the exhausted doctor caught herself smiling back when she visited his home. Despite this, and sporting the most garish hair modification she'd ever laid eyes on--a bright red of all possible colors he could have picked--she refused to be distracted from her goal. Under the pretense of a routine house call, wearing her long-tested role of the gentle, caring physician, Fantomera extracted from Malher exactly what she had been looking for for so long--electricity from nothing, sparking between his fingertips and pulling his flesh into tiny needles with it. And what had he been doing with his remarkable talents, biology that truly marked him as one in a million? Absolutely nothing. It took a great deal of Fantomera's patience not to drop her act then and there in a fit of sheer anger at the man. The good doctor would continue to carefully curate Malher's trust, hiding her absence from the southern city within Spinaunor's Grand North Hospital. There was nothing odd about one director touching base with another, after all; this, in spite of the fact Grand North's director spoke to her exactly once during her entire visit. It took two and a half months for Fantomera to craft the illusory relationship Malher believed he'd developed with her, but the morning she discovered her pregnancy, she departed without a word, having gotten exactly what she set out to do. Marianne's birthday was the only moment of pure affection she would show her daughter. The words she whispered on her newborn child's temple were loving, in their own way, but ultimately as sinister as Fantomera's intent: "You were born to inherit this world." Though Fantomera was now a mother, one would struggle to call her motherly. Barely a week after Marianne was born, she was returning to her routine at Grand South Hospital, with her infant daughter never far away--either held close or cradled by nurses ordered to remain by her side. These early years would have been ordinary, if not for an unforeseen visitor one fateful day. A short time after Marianne's first birthday, Malher arrived at the hospital and called for their director by name. He'd come all the way from the northern city, hurt by her abrupt departure, and was understandably shocked to find the woman he sought carrying a sleeping child--a child with a face uncomfortably like his own. Fantomera, placid as ever, though raging inwardly at this intrusion, this unexpected threat to her work, calmly invited him to her home for dinner. There, she promised, they could have their talk. True to her word, Fantomera prepared an exquisite meal that night, during which she coolly admitted to her guest that all she had wanted out of him was his lineage--a child born with his abilities--but since he had made himself such a nuisance in tracking her down, she would be sure to find another use for him. Malher had barely stood before the drug she slipped him kicked in. He woke up, tied to a bed in her guest room, the next morning. It's hard to say what precisely Fantomera had initially planned for her prisoner, because after a few fruitless weeks of his pleading to be let go--of screaming himself hoarse in the hopes that perhaps a neighbor would hear him--his hostess found him dead. He'd bitten off his own tongue and bled to death to escape being held there any longer. Following Marianne's thirteenth birthday, at her daughter's request no less, Fantomera began training her in surgical research and practice, pleased by the ambition of her child and viewing it as an appropriate course of study while she waited for her abilities to manifest. Marianne would not realize until decades later that her first Argion autopsy was the preserved body of the father she never got to meet. Years of lessons, of Marianne's growing power and ability, and Fantomera could not have been happier with the development she was seeing. Though she had been unsure about allowing her daughter, now nineteen and eager to apply her skills, to take lessons with the other interns of her hospital, her fears were abated when she witnessed Marianne flourishing more than she ever had when it was the two of them alone. In a sense, Fantomera was proud of her daughter--the sheer awe this young protege inspired in patients and doctors alike marked the beginning of Marianne's future in her mother's plan. Three years passed in high spirits for both mother and daughter, both for different reasons. Marianne was close to achieving the title of doctor, at the end of her training, while Fantomera was preparing the final stage for her plot. Her dear daughter had grown into everything she could have hoped for--a master of the inexplicable gifts passed down by her father, and more brilliant than any of her peers. This was the culmination of her research, she knew: the pinnacle of their race, and soon it would be time for Marianne to lend her body to the advancement of their people, in more disturbing ways than one. However, the doctor would not have the opportunity to introduce Marianne to her plan herself. Early one morning, with a flash of curtains flooding her room with sunlight, a groggy Fantomera found herself pinned by that very daughter, who just hours before had uncovered her mother's research materials. Abhorrently disgusted by her discovery, Marianne whispered a final admonishment before ending her mother's life on the spot. "I am more than what you tried to make me." These words were burned into Fantomera's mind, even beyond death. It was quite a shock that she found herself waking up, not in her bed, but on a cold metal table, just a thin white cloth separating her from the frigid air of her own morgue. From the gaping, yet painless wound she felt on her abdomen, she knew her encounter with Marianne had not been a dream, and still...she lived. At the end of her table stood a strange young man--Cain, he called himself--and he had brought her back. Even more curiously, this Cain was familiar with her wayward daughter. In the year following her death, Marianne had boarded a mysterious, magical train; he'd met the young woman there, and learned of her, he quoted, "ruthless Mam who couldn't even have a child without wanting to make it part of her megalomanic plans!" Cain needed such a person to meet his own goals, and exhumed Fantomera to help him. And if this second lease on life hadn't been enough to ingratiate himself, Cain was sure to mention one tiny stipulation of her resurrection: now more than ever, Fantomera is on borrowed time. The fatality sustained from her daughter is very slowly draining her humanity--slowly, but constantly--and without a more permanent solution (say, one that could be found on an undying vehicle of magical machinery?), she will die...this time for good. Fantomera, not one to let such an opportunity to pass her by, agreed, and the two set off on their journey.
Always smiling with just a hint of mischief in her eye, Marianne is incorrigibly optimistic, cheerful, and overall a very affectionate little lady. She playfully teases and pokes fun, but never with any unfriendly intentions. Sometimes she gets a bit overzealous and doesn't abide by laws of personal space. Many accidental shocks have come out of this. She does not like dealing with negativity and she'll smother those emotions if she starts to feel them. She's uncomfortable with anger and sadness and will be especially friendly to people who exhibit these characteristics in an attempt to cheer them up or calm them down. This is mostly for their benefit, but it's also so she can bear with being in the same room as them. Because she would much rather suppress her negative feelings than deal with them in stride, she is prone to outbursts when stressed, and this will lead to her isolating herself until she feels like she's able to wear a smile again. Pointing out any way that she seems to act like her mother is great for giving her a crisis and driving her into that isolation state. Often she'll speak without realizing she's thinking out loud, a residual habit from half a lifetime without other people. She's perceptive as a rock so it's almost impossible for her to sense moods in conversation, but that's because she's still learning about people and their nuances. Be patient with her and she'll love being around you! To Marianne, almost everything is classified as important information, including views that clash with her own. Provided those differing morals aren't hurting anyone, she's likely to spend the next twenty minutes fervently asking for every minute detail about those beliefs and how they came to form them. Knowledge is power! Her mother had no regard for the lives of others, so Marianne feels duty-bound to keep people safe, even at a personal cost and even if it means she needs to harm one to protect many. It's her attempt to make up for her mother's actions. Always thinking, she is determined to keep learning new things, and though she knows mistakes are completely necessary...she can be sarcastically overly dramatic when she gets frustrated, with the most excessive displays including (but are not limited to): temper tantrums, obnoxiously stomping around, and loud frustration-venting on a pillow or at a nearby companion.
Marianne was the daughter of a large hospital's Surgeon Director and did not have a great relationship with said director (aka, her mother)--though not for lack of trying on Marianne's part. In an attempt to grow closer to and gain her approval, young Marianne solicited her mother to teach her about biology and surgery so that she could become a doctor, just like her! Most of her life was absorbed in research (which she liked) and dissections (which she loved), and as a young woman, she believed she was on the brink of attaining the professional title and maternal recognition she so coveted when a bombshell--or rather, a file--dropped. As it turns out, Marianne was the result of her mother's lifelong hunt to isolate a magical anomaly in Argions, and from it breed the perfect form of their species. Unsurprisingly, this discovery did not sit well with her, and soon after uncovering her origins, she encountered Allison, who offered an easy out of this situation on the World Train. After a...bloody parting gift to her mother and a commemorative hair color change, Marianne boarded the train and the rest is history!
Marianne wasn't born into a very loving household, which is surprising considering the almost manically cheerful woman she would grow up to be. Fantomera Cross did not suffer with being a single mother--in fact, most of Marianne's infancy was spent in the care of nurses while her mother went back to work. Fantomera, or Dr. Cross as she would be sure to remind you, was the Director of Surgery at Spinasut's largest hospital, and had the temperament to show it. Dr. Cross was spectacularly proficient at her job, but a comforting physician she was not--Fantomera's curt and often impassive disposition was only tolerated because of her brutal efficiency in the hospital. Unfortunately, this coldness extended even towards her own daughter, and Marianne would spend much of her childhood trying to meet her mother's high expectations. Fantomera's position allowed her and a young Marianne to live very well, so the only things she ever yearned for were those that her mother most restricted. She wasn't allowed to attend school--Fantomera opted instead for a private tutor, unwilling to let her daughter mingle with "the reprobates who feed continuously off the hand of society," as she put it (much to Marianne's displeasure)--and because of that, Marianne rarely had an opportunity to meet others her own age. Time that wasn't consumed by lessons was spent at the hospital with her mother, where Dr. Cross could keep a close eye on the girl. Even the staff made themselves scarce around the young Marianne; many of them were terrified of attracting her mother's anger, as they'd been instructed not to interact extensively with her. Needless to say, Marianne's childhood was lonely and quiet, and as the years passed, she reached a last-ditch effort to lighten her life with one bright idea. Some time after Marianne's thirteenth birthday, she approached Fantomera and did two things: asked for no more tutoring, and expressed an interest in learning everything her mother had to in order to become a surgeon herself. This brought about a sliver of approval from Dr. Cross, and she, somewhat too happily, agreed to her daughter's requests. Immediately after this, Fantomera transferred several of her directorial duties to an assistant and finally gave Marianne one of the things she wanted most--her undivided attention. Their lessons began, first with enough reading and writing in half a year to fill four school semesters, and soon after, they moved to dissection. Dr. Cross started her daughter on fauna and aquatic creatures. Marianne did have some initial nausea at first, but she'd asked to learn, to grow closer to her mother through this, and so she smothered her reservations and went to work on each animal presented to her. Over time, her dissections became almost cathartic, and after another two years of alternating study and practice, Fantomera allowed her to examine her first deceased Argion. This first autopsy was surprising, for more reasons than one. The dead man possessed an anomaly Marianne had never encountered: masses of muscle had pooled at his hands, leaving much of his arms as bones draped limply with skin. Hours of examination revealed no clear explanation, much to her frustration. The second surprise came about one year after this strange autopsy, when Marianne discovered a similar change happening within her own body. Her flesh seemed to writhe under her skin--not painful, but certainly uncomfortable and entirely disturbing. However, Fantomera's reaction to was markedly...unfazed when this development was brought to her attention. It may have been her imagination, but Marianne would swear her mother was expecting this to happen. This change, Dr. Cross explained to her increasingly troubled daughter, was the result of a rare inherited ability finally manifesting itself. With practice, she would be able to put it to great use, shape herself, and eventually carve a future that "commoners"--Fantomera's eyes gleamed at this--could behold with shock and awe. Following her discovery, Marianne continued the regimen laid out for her: research, practical application, exercising these newfound skills, repeat. By the time she was sixteen, she'd practiced controlling her new powers so much that she was now able to form her own fingers into nearly every tool in her mother's medical bag. Though she knew the relationship with her mother hadn't actually changed much over the course of her surgical training--Fantomera was as cool as she'd been during her childhood--this was the lightest she'd felt in her whole life all thanks to the intense enjoyment she got out of her lessons. When she turned nineteen, Marianne was hired by her mother's hospital and, perhaps most exciting to her, was finally, finally, part of a group. She was one of a select few to be accepted--lab coats included--to intern with a resident surgeon. It wouldn't occur to her until much later that her mother may have pulled some strings to allow Marianne this opportunity. In Fantomera's eyes, it was a perfect way to display the careful culmination of these past six years. And display they did: Marianne blossomed among her fellow interns, despite a lamentable lack of social skills, and it didn't take long for her to become recognized, not as the director's daughter, but as an immensely talented young woman well on her way to becoming a full-fledged doctor. But then, the files fell. Marianne had been working at the hospital for close to three years when she came across a large, tightly-packed folder sequestered at the very back of her mother's office shelf. She'd been looking for a patient's file, and probably should have continued searching for it, but this one grabbed her attention--not only was it massive, but it had her name on it. Curiosity got the better of her, and she cracked open the folder to take a peek. Rather than a history of medical files she'd been expecting to find, Marianne was reading extensive, handwritten reports on "possible mutations", "lineage", and most disturbingly, "eventual extraction". From the massive collection, Marianne discovered this: sometime before her birth, Fantomera had become obsessed with Argions possessing the impossible ability to generate their own electricity and use it to shape their bodies to their will. She had traced hundreds of rumors before finding one of these peculiar people--and the report detailing her encounter was accompanied by a color sketch of a man Marianne recognized all too well: her first Argion autopsy, the one that had perplexed her for years. Suddenly, the lifetime of unending scientific coldness projected by her mother crashed into place: Fantomera was never raising a daughter--she was breeding a test subject, something she could create and control from the most vulnerable point in her life. And there stood that 22-year-old experiment, stunned, clutching a history she was never supposed to know, and feeling the happy lightness of her successes condense to a sour, heavy weight in her stomach. Marianne couldn't bring herself to confront Fantomera about the file. Numb and dazed, she slipped out of the hospital with the folder pressed tightly to her chest. It was the dead of night, quiet and chilled, and she wandered Spinasut for what felt like hours before a light tap on her head made her aware she was not alone on the darkened streets. Clinging to the roof of a low building was a curiously captivating woman, with dark tendrils suspending her over the side. The stranger introduced herself as Allison, and as she'd spotted the exceptionally miserable-looking Marianne exiting the hospital earlier, she had a proposition to offer. If she was unhappy with her current life and though she'd be able to handle new sights and adventures, Marianne could meet her tomorrow directly south of the city, where Spinasut ended and the treeline began. There were only a few thoughts that were perfectly clear in Marianne's mind: she now knew of her mother's twisted experiment, she now had a way to escape this fate...and she outright refused to stay another day with a woman who'd birthed a child with the soul purpose of using it as a lab rat. She told Allison she would absolutely take her up on that offer, and the two parted ways. Marianne spent the rest of the evening cramming as many clothes as she could into a single large pack, and hesitantly, stowed the pilfered file there as well. She wasn't enthralled with her discovery, but to pass up on an opportunity to learn from her mother's lifelong work would have rendered the sacrifices put into it meaningless. But stealing the file wasn't enough. Her mother had spent years tracking her first victim, and spent more still trying to mold her into a perfect specimen. That kind of drive could never be stomped out just by the loss of records, and with a clutch in her chest, Marianne knew what she had to do. When morning broke, she crept into her mother's room and threw open the curtains. Bright white light flooded into every corner and startled Fantomera awake. The back of Marianne's head prickled with heated hate as she watched the bleary-eyed woman trying to register the sudden intrusion. She whispered the last words Dr. Cross would hear before a silver spike impaled the woman several times through her heart. "I am more than what you tried to make me." Misty-headed and breathless after changing out of her blood-stained dress, Marianne gathered her overstuffed pack, her lab coat, and her medical bag, and exited her house for the last time. A thought occurred to her in her dazed, shell-shocked state, and before going to meet Allison outside the city, she stopped to enjoy one celebratory treatment her mother never would have agreed to (not that she could object now). Marianne changed her hair to the richest red the dyer could provide; a reminder of Fantomera's mistake. Upon leaving the edge of the city, Allison revealed herself from behind one of the massive trees, giving Marianne's new color a cursory look and a small smile. She led her deep into the forest, and soon they found their goal--a massive and beautiful, gleaming machine Marianne had never seen before. Allison called it the "World Train", and Marianne gleefully followed her onto it. The weight in her stomach had broken and dissolved. Marianne had spent her whole life futilely trying to live for and love someone who could have never returned those sentiments, but now, she refused to spend another second without smiling for herself. Now, she finally felt lighter than air.
"Good. Now pin back the first layer." Slightly unsteady hands, wearing too-large gloves just bloodied at the fingertips, carefully peeled away folds of cool, brittle skin to fasten them down and keep her incision open. Her mother nodded slightly. She hovered close, towering above the young girl, but never touching the body they were both so focused on; she had saved all the work just for her. Marianne's bright eyes flicked briefly to the white cloth placed over the man's head. She'd glimpsed his face, and recognized it. Not from passing on the street or within the hospital, but from her own reflection. Spying a heart-shaped face and thin, upturned nose so much like her own had sent a shiver down her spine, though she'd managed to hide her discomfort from her mother. The man's hair was peeking over the edge of the sheet, and her gaze slid over to it. Its color captivated her despite the filth clinging to it--vividly red, and marvelously different from the silver she was so used to seeing everywhere else. Her mother noticed the delay in continuing their procedure and cleared her throat. "Extract the object now, Marinette," she prodded quietly. "...Okay, Mam."
